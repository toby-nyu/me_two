      <h2>NYU London: Introduction to Web Design and Computer Principles</h2>
      <p>This course is part of the NYU Computer Science curriculum taught at the London campus. It introduces students to the fundamentals 
        of web development and computing principles. Topics include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Linux file systems. 
        Students learn client-side scripting, control structures, loops, functions, and the Document Object Model (DOM). 
        The course prepares students to build interactive, secure, and powerful web applications, 
        laying the foundation for careers in web development, software engineering, and digital design.</p>
